Built a content-based movie recommendation system using Python in Jupyter Notebook.

Implemented data preprocessing, feature extraction, and similarity computation to recommend movies effectively.

Used libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data handling and cosine similarity calculation.

Designed the system to recommend movies based on genre, keywords, cast, and overview features.

Improved recommendation accuracy through efficient vectorization techniques like TF-IDF / Count Vectorizer.
